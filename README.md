# What is This?
These are some small html projects I've made.

# How to Use?
WARNING: **These are not complete webpages.** They have no title, no decoration, no nothing.

They serve as embedded modules on your page if html blocks are supported. For example, on wikidot, you can use

```
[[html]]

Copy everything in Tarot.html

[[/html]]
```

to add a Tarot card drawer to your page.

# What do You Have?
In this repo:

`Tarot.html`: A Tarot card drawer and predictor. Multiple Horoscopes are supported. Click on each card to see its meaning.
